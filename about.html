<p>
    Hi there, I am a <u>gameplay programmer</u> in my free time and
    a <u>math student</u> (4<sup>th</sup> year)
    otherwise. Back in 2020 I jumped  on the game development train, ever since
    loving the application of skills from my studies to this exciting field.
    Currently, <u>
        I am looking for an internship or part-time
        opportunity to gain a foothold in the industry
    </u>.
</p>

<p>
    On my private game projects I prefer using <b>Unity</b>,
    with Git for Version Control.
</p>

<p>
    In addition, I have also used SVN, Jira, Redmine and different
    Kanban-tools for project management, issue tracking etc.
</p>

<p>
    Aside from all that I spend quite some time with D&D - also as Dungeon Master -
    and coaching the local youth Quidditch team.

<p>WIP</p>
<p>
    Below you see my (unfinished) first attempt at creating
    a turn-based strategy game on a hexagonal grid:

    <u>This project was an enormous learning experience</u> (and exhausting). Following are some of the more important features I got working:
    <ul>
        <li>pathfinding and unit movement</li>
        <li>a resource system</li>
        <li>an ugly radial menu for placing buildings</li>
        <li>unit and building placement and upgrades</li>
        <li> ... and a lot more of smaller features (including a health system, basic static enemies)...</li>
    </ul>
    I ended up stopping development because
    <ol>
        <li>it became more and more unwieldy, so I figured that taking a break would help refocus my energies for redesigning and rethinking the project architecture at a later point,</li>
        <li>I grew interested in creating a 3D version of this game,</li>
        <li>not to mention university getting in the way :|</li>
    </ol>
    Anyways, currently I am pouring my time into experimenting with the 3D version.
    <u>Check out the next post for more info (and a demo!) on that.</u>

    Some time ago I saw
    <a style="color : blue" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I">this video</a>
    of Tom Scott playing a curiously looking boardgame.
    And found it so interesting that I wanted to implement it as an exercise &#128517;
</p>
<p>
    At the moment it can be played locally with two players (*) or against an AI.
    The game sadly still has (at least) one bug: landing on a green field and rolling a 0 does not
    end the player's turn (at least not when playing against the AI).
    <!--
    The AI sadly still has one or two bugs, which I did not get to fix yet.
    -->

    Shoot me a message if you notice any other bugs!
</p>
<p>
    The rules of the game can be found
    <a style="color : blue" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur#Basic_rules">on Wikipedia</a>
    although the implementation might differ in minor aspects.
</p>
<p>
    After fixing the AI I want to add an online multiplayer mode.

<p>(*) Don't ask how often I've played against myself for testing purposes o.O</p>
